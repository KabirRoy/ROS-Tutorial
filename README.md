# ROS Tutorial cum Challenge

Hello everyone,
Hope you are safe and doing some productive work at home. If you are enthusiastic in robotics then, Electronics and Robotics Club is here once again to help you out in exploring this field along with ITSP.
Have you ever wondered “How to coordinate between multiple drones? How to simulate a manipulator or robot? How does a robot map the environment and navigate in it?” Answer to each and every question is ROS! These are only some of its applications. ROS applications go far beyond your imagination, above are only some basic things to mention. So what exactly is ROS?

___ROS___, which means the Robot Operating System, is a set of software libraries and tools to help you build robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. The point of ROS is to create a __robotics standard__, so you don't need to __reinvent the wheel anymore when building new robotic software.__


| Sr. | Week   | Tasks |
:---: |:------:|:------|
| 1 | Week 1 | Ubuntu installation, get familiar with Linux commands, ROS setup |
| 2	| Week 2 | Get an overview of ROS Framework and get familiar with Basic terms of ROS framework |
| 3	| Week 3 | Create your first simulation! And perform the task that can be implemented in real life! |
| 4	| Week 4 |Autonomous Navigation and path planning |

### Main Objectives of this Tutorial:
1. The objective of this course is to give you the basic tools and knowledge to be able to understand and create any basic ROS related project. You will be able to move robots, read their sensor data, make the robots perform intelligent tasks, see visual representations of complex data such as laser scans and debug errors in the programs.
1. This will allow you to understand the packages that others have done. So you can take ROS code made by others and understand what is happening and how to modify it for your own purposes
1. This can serve as an introduction to be able to understand the ROS documentation of complex ROS packages for object recognition, text to speech, navigation and all the other areas where ROS developed code.

## Week 1
* __Ubuntu Installation__ :
For using Ros framework Ubuntu is necessary:
(It's Preferable that you install Ubuntu 16.04)
Follow this [Tutorial](https://parthvpatil.github.io/tutorial/2019/06/03/ubuntu.html "Ubuntu Installation") to install ubuntu in your laptop.  
<span style="color:red">[WARNING], Do at your own risk! We will be not responsible if you lose your data. __Follow instructions carefully and make backups before you start!__</span>

* __Get familiar with Linux__:
Here are a few resources that you can refer to in order to get familiar with Linux:
	* [Video-based Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVquJh3DXUA "Introduction to Linux and Basic Linux Commands for Beginners")
	* [Text-based Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/ "Linux Tutorial")

* __Ros Installation/setup__:
	- For Ubuntu 16.04: [ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation "kinetic/Installation")
	- For Ubuntu 18.04: [ROS Melodic Morena](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation "melodic/Installation")    
Go to a particular link and put your first step in the world of ROS.
